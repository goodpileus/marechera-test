The person may have been real but the legend that is Dambudzo Marechera, who was part rebel, part iconoclast, is a mountain high <i>papier mâché</i> god we have all created. These constructions of Marechera we share among each other have been ignored in the prevailing scholarship of the author. This is a three-part project, which complicates Marechera’s biography as has been officially told through the <i>DAMBUDZO MARECHERA: A Source Book of his Life and Work</i> first published in 1992 in Harare.</p>
